= {lab_name}

This lab will take you through a journey through the ins and outs of Red Hat Insights.
Your RHEL host will be the primary focus of this lab, and you will be using a user account that has access to all of the services of Insights, however to provide the best experience for all users there are some actions you will not be able to do in the lab - these can be demonstrated by your facilitator.

NOTE:  At the time of the guide's authoring all of the steps were correct and matched the user interface you will see during the lab.  However, Insights is a software-as-a-service offering amd the interface can and does regularly change as new features and caapbilties are released.  As a result there may be some minor variations between what is in the guide and what you see when you take the lab.
