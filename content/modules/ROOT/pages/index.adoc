This lab will take you through a journey through the ins and outs of Red Hat Insights.
Your RHEL host will be the primary focus of this lab, and you will be using a user account that has access to all of the services of Insights, however to provide the best experience for all users there are some actions you will not be able to do in the lab - these can be demonstrated by your facilitator.
