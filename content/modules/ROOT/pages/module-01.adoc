= Registration, Inventory, and Images

== Overview

In this lab we have already provided for you a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 host. +
Your RHEL host will be the primary focus of this lab, and you will be using a user account that has access to all of the services of Insights, however to provide the best experience for all users there are some actions you will not be able to do in the lab 


Insights uses the insights-client on each RHEL host to report system facts to Insights for analysis.  +
The insights-client is typically part of the base RHEL image, but you will need to register the host to Insights through a registration command. +
We will start by connecting this host to Insights.

== Connecting to Insights

There are a couple of different ways to connect to Insights.  In this lab we will use a manual command, but you can also register from a Red Hat Satellite Server if your host is connected to a Satellite or you can leverage an ansible playbook.  If you connect your cloud provider to the Hybrid Cloud Console (console.redhat.com) then systems in the cloud can be automatically registered to Red Hat and Insights.

We will use the rhc command (remote host configuration) which wraps the subscription-manager and the insights registration command into a single command while also enabling some other capabilities like Insights remediation.

We will use an activation key that already exists as well as the organization ID. 

Connect to host via SSH

Run the command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo rhc connect -o 13959588 -a AK_Summit_Lab
----

In the output you should see something similar to:


[source,textinfo]
----
[lab-user@myhost ~]$ sudo rhc connect -o 13959588 -a AK_Summit_Lab 
Connecting myhost.example.com to Red Hat.
This might take a few seconds.
● Connected to Red Hat Subscription Management
● Connected to Red Hat Insights
● Activated the Remote Host Configuration daemon
● Enabled console.redhat.com services: remote configuration, insights, compliance, remediations
Successfully connected to Red Hat!
Manage your connected systems: https://red.ht/connector
[lab-user@myhost ~]$ 
----



Your host is now connected to Red Hat and Insights.

This system should now be visible in Insights. +
Open up the Hybrid Cloud Console.

NOTE: You will need to open a new browser window to access the Hybrid Cloud Console - It won't connect in a window like the terminal window does.  In the upper right of these instructions you should see a `Links` button.  You can select the Hybrid Cloud Console from the Links OR you can manually type in console.redhat.com

== Accessing Insights

Log into the Hybrid Cloud Console with the following credentials: 

User:
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
lab-EB9A
----

Password:
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
R3dh4t2024!
----

This is the main page of the Hybrid Cloud Console.   
There are several offerings available on the Hybrid Cloud Console including Red Hat Insights which is included with subscriptions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

You are going to go through a series of exercises for the rest of this lab that take you through some of the services in the Hybrid Cloud Console.
You will not have an exercise for every service nor will your user have access to every function and feature.  
While this may be disappointing at times, permissions were granted to your user to provide the best overall experience for all of the users taking this lab at the same time.

== Creating an image

NOTE: While your system is now connected to Insights, you are creating an image first as the image creation process takes several minutes once it is initiated.  Starting with this activity gives it time to complete before the end of the module.

In this lab environment we provided you a system.   The system was already created with the packages you need to complete these lab exercises.
Insights is also capable of creating system images inside of Insights.
You can also launch these images directly into a public cloud - AWS, Azure, GCP, or OCI.

Images can be created in a variety of formats including .ova, .qcow2, and .iso.
This is all based on RHEL's image builder capabilities. 

At the top of the page you will see a search bar. +  
Type `image`. +
Click the result `Images | Red Hat Insights` +

This will take you to the Images page inside of Insights.

You have image creation options for `Conventional (RPM-DNF)` as well as `Immutable (OSTree)` via the tabs at the top.
The default is `Conventional (RPM-DNF)` which is where you will focus in this activity.

Click the `Create image` button.
This starts a wizard that helps you create a custom image.

The numbers align with the steps in the wizard, assuming that you follow the steps below. +

. `Image Output`
.. In the image output start by selecting a release version.  It defaults to the latest version. +
In the dropdown list for `Release` select `Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8`. +
Since you have selected an older version, the release lifecycle information is displayed so that you know where this older release is in the lifecycle. +
.. Leave the architecture as `x86_64`.  `aarch64` is also an option with this release.
.. Notice that `Select target environments` is plural as you could select multiple options here. +
.. Select `Amazon Web Services` (AWS).  You may notice that in the list of steps on the left you get a new `Target environment` step added as a result of this selection. (Make sure you only have AWS selected)
.. Click `Next`
. `Target environment - Amazon Web Services`
.. In the Hybrid Cloud Console you have the ability to configure `Sources`.  One of the sources already added is Amazon Web Services (AWS).  In the Source the AWS information is already listed and communication with AWS has been established.  This enables you to create images and register them with AWS very quickly and easily.  It also enables you to launch images if you had sufficient permissions.
.. Under `Share method` the default is `Use an account configured from Sources`.  This would use entries from the Sources in the Hybrid Cloud Console.  
.. Under `Source Name` select `RH_AWS`.  Notice that this auto populates the default region and the account ID.
.. Click `Next`
. `Register`
.. This wizard makes it simple and easy for images created by Insights to connect to both Red Hat (subscription-manager) and Insights specifically.  It is suggested to use the `Automatically register and enable advanced capabilities` option - this is the default selection.  However due to permissions you will not be able to select this in the lab environment. 
.. If the automatic registration was selected, registration is handled through activation keys.  This keeps you from transmitting username and password information and also lets you set system purpose information based on the activation keys in use.  Activation keys can be created and managed inside of the Hybrid Cloud Console - If you have the appropriate access.  In order to make sure that the lab is usable for all, access to Activation keys has been removed for your user.
.. Select `Register later`.
.. Click `Next`
. `OpenSCAP`
.. Image builder can create images that are intended to be evaluated by OpenSCAP compliance policies based on the RHEL SCAP Security Guide.   In this step you can pick a policy to be evaluated against.
.. While you should feel free to select the drop down box, leave this at `None`.  Changing the setting would affect the other steps below. 
.. Click `Next`
. `File system configuration`
.. You can use automatic partitioning or you can manually configure the partitions.  
.. Select `Manually configure partitions`.  This opens up a new table where you can add additional partitions.
.. Click `Add partition`
.. Set `/home` to '5 GiB`.
.. Click `Add partition`
.. Click the `/home` dropdown and select `/tmp`
.. Set `/tmp` to `2 GiB`
.. Your system will now be created with a 10GB root, a 5 GB home, and a 2GB tmp partition.
.. Click `Next`
. `Content`
.. In this section you can add packages to your image.  
.. Under `Available packages` in the `Search for a package` area type `postgres` and press enter.
.. Scroll down the list and find `postgresql-server` and click it.
.. In the center area between the two boxes, you will see some arrows.  `>`, and `>>`,
.. Click `>`.  This will list the `postgresql-server` package in the right box, making it a `Chosen package`.
.. Under `Available packages` in the `Search for a package` area, remove any existing text (You can clisk the `x` in the search box) then type `openscap` and hit enter.
.. Scroll down the list and find `openscap` and click it.
.. Click `>` to make it a chosen package.
.. The `Chosen packages` list now contains `postgresql-server` and `openscap`.  
.. Repeat with any additional desired packages.
.. Click `Next`
.. You can also optionally select any `Custom repositories`.  These custom repositories are managed in the `Content` section and will be covered later.
.. Click `Next`
. `Details`
+
WARNING: Read the text under `Image Name`.  The image name can be 3-63 characters long. It can contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, has to start with a letter and cannot end with a hyphen.  If you have an error in this step your name probably contains a period or uppercase letter.
+
NOTE: Please add some sort of unique identifier to the image name.  We suggest using your host’s unique hostname. Since your hostname includes a period you should only use the text before the period.
+
.. Name your image.  Under `Image Name` enter a name such as `rhel8-postgres-<yoursystemname>` +
Reminder: your system name is: {bastion_hostname}
.. Add a description of the image if desired.
.. Click `Next`
. `Review`
.. In the `Review` section you can expand the different areas and review the selections that you have made.
.. Click `Create image`

The image build process has started.  
We will return to this section prior to completing this module to allow time for the image to be created.

NOTE: The image creation process will take several minutes (around 10-15 average based on the above selections).


== Seeing your system in the Inventory

At this point you want to see the system that you connected to Insights. +
In order to do this, you need to go to the RHEL inventory.  

In the search bar at the top of the page, type: Inventory

There will be several matches.  Select: Inventory | Red Hat Insights 

You will be redirected to the Systems view of the Inventory.   +
This view shows you all of the RHEL hosts that the Hybrid Cloud Console knows about - not all of these systems are necessarily reporting to Insights.  

In addition to Insights, subscription-manager (subman) and Red Hat Satellite also report systems to this inventory to give you a more complete view of your total RHEL estate.

In the list of systems locate your host. +
Reminder: your system name is: {bastion_hostname}

It should be near the top of the page since it was recently connected, but you can also use the “Filter by name” to easily find your system.  Click on the system name to view details about your system.

The inventory view of your specific system will give you an idea of the type of information that Insights uses for its analysis.  

Based on the information that is collected, Insights has analyzed the system and within the inventory view you can see select findings on the Advisor, Vulnerability, Compliance, Patch, and Resource Optimization tabs.   Not all of these tabs will initially have data - this is expected as some services like Compliance and Resource Optimization require additional configuration.  +
We will spend more time on some of these in subsequent exercises.

NOTE: We will not cover every service in Insights during this lab as there is a lot to cover and limited time.  If you have any questions about specific services, please ask your lab facilitators.

Make sure you are still on the `General information` tab and scroll down to the bottom.
You will see a section called `Data collectors`.
This is the section that lets you know where the inventory is getting your system information from.
You should see `insights-client` as active for your system.  

That lets you know that the system is registered via the insights-client. +
The `rhc connect` command that you ran earlier did this for you.


== Additional Inventory menu items

Let's look at other information exposed to you in the inventory section of Insights.
Consider this a brief tour of the inventory.

=== Inventory Groups

On the left hand navigation bar, click Inventory to expand it, then click Groups.  
From this point forward this navigation will be shown as: `Inventory --> Groups`

NOTE: Depending on your screen resolution the left hand navigation bar may automatically minimize.  You may need to click the hamburger menu (3 lines stacked on top of each other) in the upper left corner in order to see the menu bar.

Inventory Groups are a way to group systems together in a way that makes sense to you.  
Once grouped you can then apply role based access controls to the group.
For example, we could have created a group for systems created in this lab, then only given your user access to the systems in that group - you would never see any other systems.
For example, you may want the web development team to only access their servers and no others.  This can be achieved today through inventory groups.  The current implementation has some gaps, so expect to see enhancements in this area in the near future.

Your user can select a group but cannot add new groups or add systems to groups.  You also don't have the ability to apply access control on groups.  As a result the `Create group` button is not available to you.

Click `RAL`.  This is a group that has 7 hosts.
At the top are two tabs - `Systems` and `Group info`.
You default to the `Systems` tab where you can see the system names assigned to this group.
Again, your user only has read permissions here, so the `Add systems` button is not available to you.

Click the `Group info` tab.
This section would redirect you to the role based access control area of the Hybrid Cloud Console.
Again, your user only has read permissions here, so the `Manage access` button is not available to you.


== System Configuration section
This guide will briefly cover the items in the System Configuration section. 

=== Remote Host Configuration (RHC)
Remote host configuration (rhc) allows you to register with Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM), connect to Red Hat Insights, and manage your Insights connections with one command.

RHC enables some additional capabilities for Insights for directly connected hosts as well as for hosts connected via Red Hat Satellite.

These additional capabilities can be controlled from this page with the proper permissions.
You don't have access to Remote Host Configuration manager in this lab and will not be able to access this section.

Here is an example of what the Remote Host Configuration Manager page looks like:

image::rhc_config_Page.png[rhc_config_Page,100%,100%]


=== Activation Keys
Activation keys assist you in registering systems and prevent you from having to type in a username and password.
Metadata such as role, system purpose, and usage can be automatically attached to systems via an activation key, and monitored with the Subscription service in Insights.

You don't have access to Activation keys in this lab and will not be able to access this section.

Here is an example of what the Activation Key page might look like:

image::AK_config_page.png[AK_config_page,100%,100%]


=== Staleness and Deletion
Staleness and deletion is a new feature released in April 2024. This feature lets you adjust the timings on when systems are considered stale or when they get deleted from the Insights inventory.

Click: `Inventory --> System Configuration --> Staleness and Deletion` +
Historically Insights for RHEL has had these rules:

For `Conventional (RPM-DNF)` based systems:

* A system is stale after 1 day (24 hours) without sending data
* A system gets a stale warning after 7 days of not sending data.  This warning means the system is at risk from being removed from the inventory.
* A system is deleted after 14 days of sending no data.  If you want to add this system back into the inventory it will need to be re-registered with Insights.

For `Immutable (OSTree)` based systems:

* A system is state after 2 days without sending data
* A system gets a stale warning after 180 days without sending data
* A system is deleted after 2 years of sending no data.  If you want to add this system back into the inventory it will need to be re-registered with Insights.

The `Staleness and Deletion` section allows you to edit these defaults to better meet your needs.

NOTE: Your user has a viewer role only and cannot change the current settings.

The `Edit` button is not available for your user.
However, if it was you would be able to change the settings of each of these value to better meet your needs.
Perhaps you have systems that get turned off for extended periods of time and you want to extend system deletion from 14 days to 60 days.  

Here is an example of what this might look like:

image::CustomStalenessDeletion.png[CustomStalenessDeletion,100%,100%]


=== Data Collection and Security information

One of the most common questions about Insights has to do with the data collected, so the Insights team wanted to include a brief discussion on data collection and security information +
It should be reiterated that you have complete control over what information Insights for RHEL gathers - while we have exposed the hostname and IP addresses of the systems in the lab, this information is easily obfuscated via a switch in the client.   Additional information can also be obfuscated including keywords, patterns, and specific files.

Information about data collection can be found on the https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights/data-application-security[Red Hat Insights data and application security page].

This page also will tell you how to do things like obfuscate data or perform a collection for inspection to see everything that Insights collects.

It is also important to mention that in our lab we directly connected a system to Insights.  Port 443 is all that needed to be open. +  
A web proxy is supported. +
If you use Satellite, the connection is automatically proxied through capsules (if used) to the Satellite, then onto Insights - no configuration is needed.

Additional information can be found in the http://redhat.com/insightsfaq[frequently asked questions document].

== Checking on your image
Hopefully by this point enough time has lapsed that your image has completed building.
As mentioned earlier this typically takes 10-15 minutes with the selections identified in the lab exercise, but the additional load on the environment may cause this to take a little longer.

Return to the Images area.
Click: `Inventory --> Images`

In the table at the bottom of the page locate your image.
Under the `Status` column you should see `Ready`. +
If not, that is ok - Ready status isn't required to complete the exercise.

NOTE: If the system isn't ready feel free to come back at a later time.  

In the `Instance` column you should notice the word Launch.

NOTE:  Your user can open the wizard to see the `Launch` options, but it does not have the permissions necessary to actually launch the image into the cloud provider.

Here is an image of what the Launch wizard looks like:

image::Launch_Wizard.png[Launch_Wizard,100%,100%]

In the `Launch` wizard you can select the accout, the region, the instance type (this is a nice type-ahead box - typing `t3` will show you all of the t3 instance types for example), any templates that you have created on the cloud provider, and the number of instances you want to launch.

The next step would allow you to select or upload an ssh key for use to connect to the system. 
While you cannot complete launching an image in this lab, we do have videos of this available that you can watch later or your lab facilitator can show this functionality.


This module is complete.
